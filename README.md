### This project turns an Arduino Nano into an advanced controller board for the table game "UNO Extreme / Attack"

As additional hardware components I utilized a L293D motor driver and a DF PlayerMini Sound moule for funny sounds.
The yellow button will be printed in transluzent filament and backlit by two WS2812b LEDs, lighting up accordingly to the game.
<br /><br />

**To compile this project, you will need to install a few additional libraries:**
<br />
  DFRobotDFPlayerMini <br /> 
  FastLED
<br /><br />
  
*TODO*
<br />
Thingiverse file for the button is missing yet.
