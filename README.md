### This project turns an Arduino Nano into an advanced controller board for the table game "UNO Extreme / Attack"

As additional hardware components I utilized a L293D motor driver and a DFPlayerMini Sound module for funny sounds.
Later I integrated an HC-05 Bluetoot module to change settings via phone.
The big yellow button will be printed in translucent filament and backlit by two WS2812b LEDs, lighting up accordingly to the game.
<br /><br />

**To compile this project, you will need to install a few additional libraries:**
<br />
  DFRobotDFPlayerMini <br /> 
  FastLED
<br /><br />

I also made an APP with Thunkable, with which you can chane volume, mode and other settings :)
  
You can find the file for the button also on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2492998">Thingiverse</a>.
